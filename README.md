# Text-Classification-Analysis-Project
This project focuses on the practical aspects of text classification, specifically identifying offensive and non-offensive speech in a balanced dataset using machine learning models.

It involves a comparative analysis of the Random Forest Classifier and the Decision Tree Classifier to classify speech as informative or non-informative. 

Additionally, the project explores the insights derived from this analysis and discusses their implications for the development of effective moderation policies for online platforms.
